Dating App: Clement, Regan

Idea – The app should focus on grouping people with similar backgrounds together (as most of the dating/socializing apps basically throw everyone together). Except for basic info like names, location, age, height (important). Some of the criteria I have thought of:

1.	Job (Occupation, we can define the first matching through it)
2.	School (Registration with school email required, so that we can control the background better, match intelligence level, or pride in superficial terms)
3.	Major (I think a lot of apps overlooked this as your school majors defined the interest and topics. Lets say, a finance major / accounting major can match with someone who are artsy (who may bring more information), conversations may go smoother)
4.	Type – (Basically ask the person to categorize himself into a type, like sporty? Nerdy? Etc) 
	- how accurate is this though?
	- Algorithmically classify the person into sporty/nerdy/etc and compare algorithmic classification to how he/she classifies himself/herself


I feel like categorizing stuff will be an easier control for us.

I don’t really like self description and writing as people can write fake stuff. 

Throw some ideas!!!!!!
